=========================

Use webcam to monitor temperature in Smoker Using OpenCV

This project is to use a raspberry Pi with a cheap webcam to monitor
smoker temperature on the Brinkman Smoke 'n' Grill (ECB)

The code will by written in python with the end game temperatures
being written to a my-sql DB at regular intervals and being interpreted
to a web front end.

openCV will be used to read the temperature guage.


This is in no way meant to be a fully fledged temperature guide, and will give only very rough readings
It's just for fun and hopefully to learn something new, so don't take it too seriously.
